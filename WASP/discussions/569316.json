I am calling the import-module function along with setting the execution policy for the local system to unrestricted.  I was using this module correctly until I had an issue with Excel.  Since rebooting, I have not been able to get this to work correctly in ISE (x86 or x64).  I'm currently using PS 2.0 and have also attempted to add AddPSSnapin WASP to my profile.ps1 file.<br />\n",
