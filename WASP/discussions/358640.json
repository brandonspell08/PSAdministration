    "Html": "The System.Windows.UIAutomation namespace in .Net enables automation similar to what WASP does. \r<br />\n<br />\nI wrote a Script Module based on System.Windows.UIAutomation (aka SWA, aka UIAutomation) and posted it to PoshCode, and that's where the current development has been. It's past time I posted it here, of course, because it's just about ready for real use and probably needs beta testers more than anything else.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe cool thing about using SWA is that I don't have to provide a binary module, because the stuff that's necessary is built into the .Net Framework.  The frustrating thing about it is that it is designed for systems and developers that think differently than PowerShell normally does, and every time I've tried to make it fit the PowerShell model better I've come up short ;-)<br />\n",
