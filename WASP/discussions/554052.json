After a lot of searching (and a lot of failed VBScripts) I came across this tool.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe only problem is, Set-WindowPosition doesn't seem to work with the OSK window.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn other words, the following command works:<br />\n<pre><code>select-window notepad | select -first 1 | set-windowposition -x 600 -y 200</code></pre>\n\nBut this one does not:<br />\n<pre><code>select-window osk | select -first 1 | set-windowposition -x 600 -y 200</code></pre>\n\nIt does, however, pull up the OSK if it had been minimized, which I guess is nice (it cuts out a step in the script).\r<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, I can close the window just fine using:<br />\n<pre><code>select-window osk | select -first 1 | remove-window</code></pre>\n\nCan anyone tell if I'm doing something wrong or if I want is even possible?<br />\n",
