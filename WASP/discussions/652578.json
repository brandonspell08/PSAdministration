    "Html": "If I just want to send one or two windows to another desktop, Winkey+arrow is fine. Iâ€™d like to be able to send a list or maybe a category of windows to another desktop. Say, send all remote desktops and SSH windows to a desktop. Or all email windows to a desktop.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt would also be nice to be able to script adding a desktop.  Scenario: desktop is way too cluttered. Run script that adds another desktop (maybe I already have one, so this will be #3) and then move all my open emails to that desktop.<br />\n",
