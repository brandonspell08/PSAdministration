I've been wanting a scriptable way to &quot;clean up&quot; my windows and return them to my preferred sizes and locations for quite a while now. Phantastisch!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One tiny little annoyance -- why doesn't it accept -Left 0 or -Top 0 for a WindowPosition? Those are certainly valid locations on screen. But if I use them, whichever parameter has the 0 value is simply ignored while the rest are accepted. I'm guessing there's\r\n some bizarreness with the behavior of the underlying API...?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again!</p>\r\n",
