<div class="wikidoc"><h3>My standard demo:</h3><pre>
## Open a couple windows
notepad.exe
explorer.exe
## list the windows
Select-Window | ft â€“auto
## Activate Notepad
Select-Window notepad* | Set-WindowActive
## Close Explorer
Select-Window explorer | Select -First 1 | Remove-WIndow
## Run a few more copies of notepad
notepad; notepad; notepad; notepad;
## Move them around so we can see them all ... (Note the use of foreach with the incrementation)
$i = 1;$t = 100; Select-Window notepad | ForEach { Set-WindowPosition -X 20 -Y (($i++)*$t) -Window $_ }
## Put some text into them ...
Select-Window notepad | Send-Keys &quot;this is a test&quot;
## Close the first notepad window by pressing ALT+F4, and pressing Alt+N
## In this case, you don&#39;t have to worry about shifting focus to the popup because it&#39;s modal
## THE PROBLEM with sending keys like that is:
##    if there is no confirmation dialog because the file is unchanged, the Alt+N still gets sent
Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Send-Keys &quot;%{F4}%n&quot;
## Close the next notepad window ... 
## By asking nicely (Remove-Window) and then hitting &quot;n&quot; for &quot;Don&#39;t Save&quot;
## If there are no popups, Select-ChldWindow returns nothing, and that&#39;s the end of it
Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | 
   Select-ChildWindow | Send-Keys &quot;n&quot;
## Close the next notepad window the hard way 
## Just to show off that our &quot;Window&quot; objects have a ProcessID and can be piped to kill
Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | kill
## A different way to confirm Don&#39;t Save (use CLICK instead of keyboard)
## Notice how I dive in through several layers of Select-Control to find the button?
## This can only work experimentally: 
## use SPY++, or run the line repeatedly, adding &quot;|Select-Control&quot; until you see the one you want
Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | 
   Select-childwindow | select-control| select-control| select-control -title &quot;Do&amp;n&#39;t Save&quot; | Send-Click
## But now we have the new -Recurse parameter, so it&#39;s easy.  Just find the window you want and ...
Select-Window notepad | Select -First 1 | Remove-Window -Passthru | 
   Select-childwindow | select-control -title &quot;Do&amp;n&#39;t Save&quot;  -recurse | Send-Click
</pre><br />
<h3>My favorite use: re-dock all visual studio tool windows</h3><pre>
## NOTE: 0, 0 is the resize corner, so you need to specify X,Y coordinates for the click:
Select-Window devenv | Select-ChildWindow | Send-Click 10 10 -Double
